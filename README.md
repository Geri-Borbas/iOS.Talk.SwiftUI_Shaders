This session offers a general overview of shaders, explores useful mindsets through the process of building a shader from scratch. Topics covered include approaches to designing shaders, translating visual ideas into mathematical abstractions, and eventually into code. The talk highlights how to leverage existing SwiftUI animation and interaction techniques to drive shader calculations. All this is showcased through real-world examples, including reverse engineering the Apple Intelligence Siri animation with detailed code samples.
